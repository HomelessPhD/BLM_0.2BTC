I've found it one the reddit [1,2]. Also it was mentioned in a few bitcointalk topics [3].
There is the BTC address [4] filled with 0.2 BTC on 2020-05-10 11:01 and the picture (see "pictures" folder) where this address appears withing a "puzzle".
Thats all the data for now - several variant of the same pictures acquired from several sources. Later i'll try to find some patterns and documents my findings here.

I am poor Ukrainian student that will really appreciate any donations.
I have no home (flat\appartment), live in the dorm trying to accumulate funds
for the smallest flat in the city - with no success at the moment,
have nearly 10% of needed amount.

P.S. Successfully evacuated from occupied regions of Ukraine.
